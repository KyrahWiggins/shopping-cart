SHOPPING CART
Using React-Redux I was able to create a project that is a basic e-commerce website with a shopping cart that allows you to add the capabilities of adding the quantity and removing an item or all the items.

Features

Add and remove items
Remove items
Edit the quantity of the items in real time
Calculate automatically the total including the shipping (if chosen)
